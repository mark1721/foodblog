# Project FoodBlog
This project will be developed using ReactJS with the help of MaterialUI, Styled Components, and React Router.

## Requirements
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Mongo Online (MLab)

## Getting Started
Let's start with installations first. Then running.

### Installations
Run
```
npm install
```

Every dependencies should have been installed since it's saved on "package.json".
### Running
You may want to run the server first before the client just so the data can be fetched from Mlab first.

So, open server/server.js, then run using:

```
node server.js
```
Now in root folder, just run:

```
npm start
```

That's it! Have fun playing around.
